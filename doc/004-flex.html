  c.H2`Motivation`,
  c.H3`The problem`,
  c.P`\
    Once upon a time, I needed to create a complex layout. Soon I have realised
    that this layout will consist of several levels of embedded blocks arranged
    either in rows or columns, and are aligned horizontally and vertically in
    one of the ways vector drawing programs allow you to align selected
    elements.`,
  c.P`\
    Having realised that, I started imagining a graphical program that would
    allow me to add nested blocks and choose their alignment with switches on
    the side panel.`,
  c.P`\
    Next, I thought, I would add keyboard shortcuts to this program, as it is
    faster for me to click the block and press a key on the keyboard, rather
    than move the mouse to the side panel, click the corresponding button and
    move the mouse back. It may look as if I am overly dramatising such a
    trivial action, but anyone who has done it thousands of times per day knows
    that automating such things may save you literally half of a working time.`,
  c.P`\
    So, as I press those keys, blocks would change their alignment and
    orientation. What keys would that be? When I press ${KEY`H`}, all children
    of the block will immediately be arranged horizontally. If I press ${KEY`V`},
    the block will instantly transform to a vertical column. Time saved from
    extra mouse movements, selecting and clicking.`,
  c.P`\
    So far, so good. How will I align the elements? If I press ${KEY`L`} on the 
    selected block, all its children will be aligned to the left. ${KEY`R`} is
    for right, ${KEY`C`} for centre.`,
  c.P`\
    At the same time, I can also choose the vertical alignment: ${KEY`T`} for
    top, ${KEY`B`} for bottom and ${KEY`M`} for middle. It is good that there
    exists another word and another letter for the vertical centre, "middle".`,
  c.H3`Thinking further`,
  c.P`\
    Should I start an endeavour of writing a graphical block-aligning program?
    It seems to be a terrific idea for the start-up. Everyone needs that. 
    Everyone will love it. I will become famous and will earn billions of
    dollars on subscriptions! Awesome!`,
  c.P`\
    However, after giving that thought another 1.5 minutes of time, I came to
    the conclusion that it would indeed be awesome in the correct meaning of the
    word, also woeful, horrible and wrong on so many levels. I will elaborate no
    longer what abyss opened before me, as there is not enough space and
    time to even start approaching its due description.`,
  c.P`\
    Having quickly regained my sanity, I concentrated on the outcome. If the
    above program had been written, what would its material result be?
    In a technical sense, it would always be a file which contains the layout,
    which, in any case, must be obtained from the program, and the content,
    developed elsewhere, somehow incorporated into the layout. Would it be much
    better if the content is authored in its normal environment (that's
    presumably a code editor), and the layout in some way created in the same
    place, by pressing the same keys mentioned above?`,
  c.P`\
    The next realisation was that a decent syntax to express structural
    relationships between elements is well known. Let's say, ${KEY`element1`},
    ${KEY`element2`} and ${KEY`element3`} are given. If element3 follows
    element2, there is already a widely accepted convention on how to show that: 
    ${KEY`element2, element3`}. If they are the children of element1, it is
    simple and widely recognisable to express that as
    ${KEY`element1(element2, element3)`}. Such relationships can be extended
    arbitrarily far: as many elements following each other as needed, and as
    many levels of parent-child hierarchy can be expressed in the above syntax.`,
  c.P`\
    Of course, since this is about the construction of a DOM structure, possibly
    via HTML, this all is obvious, but I find it useful to go back to the
    fundamentals, as it helps to see the possibilities which are not always
    obvious if one is overwhelmed with all the implementation details.`,
  c.P`\
    Talking about implementation details, if this is related to HTML, it has
    classes, and if I create a class with its name consisting of three letters:
    orientation, horizontal alignment and vertical alignment, and define it
    accordingly, the goal is achieved. For example,
    ${KEY`div.${c.B`hlm`}(el1, el2, el3)`}: ${c.B`h`}orizontal container with
    children aligned ${c.B`l`}eft horizontally and to the ${c.B`m`}iddle
    vertically.`,
  c.P`\
    The same result, just by pressing the same three-key chord on the keyboard,
    getting the structure formed as quickly as possible and all that without
    leaving your favourite text editor. ${c.S`Awesome!`}`,
  c.H2`Details`,
  c.P`\
    Following the discussion above, class names should be formed
    from the three parts: orientation,
    horizontal alignment and vertical alignment, where orientation is either
    ${KEY`h`} for a horizontal row or ${KEY`v`} for a vertical column of
    elements.`,
  c.P`\
    Horizontal alignment is one of the letters ${KEY`l|c|r`} (left/centre/right),
    and vertical alignment is either of ${KEY`t|m|b`} (top/middle/bottom).`,
  c.P`\
    Let's add some useful options. First of all, instead of being pushed to the
    side, elements can stretch. Let the letter ${KEY`s`} be
    used to express that. For example, ${KEY`.hss`} class is a horizontal row
    where elements stretch both vertically and horizontally to occupy all the
    available space.`,
  c.P`\
    Secondly, there are other ways to distribute the unoccupied space: between
    the elements, around the elements and evenly. Let ${KEY`_b`} stand for
    "space between", ${KEY`_a`} for "space around" and ${KEY`_e`} for
    "space evenly". These must work for any orientation, e.g. ${KEY`.vl_a`} is
    a vertical column where the spare vertical space is distributed around the
    elements, and horizontally they are aligned to the left. Another example:
    ${KEY`.h_as`}: a horizontal row with spare horizontal space distributed
    around the elements that are stretched vertically.`,
  c.P`\
    In third, there is a unique type of vertical alignment in a horizontal row:
    by the baseline. If can be by the first or by the last baseline. ${KEY`bf`}
    and ${KEY`bl`} will stand for that, accordingly. ${KEY`.hlbl`} is a
    horizontal row where the items are aligned left and by their last baseline.`,
  c.P`\
    The resulting complete grammar is:${c.Br}
    ${KEY`(h|v) × (l|c|r|s|_a|_b|_e) × (t|m|b|s|_a|_b|_e|bf|bl)`}.`,
  c.P`\
    That initially produces 2×7×9 = 126 combinations.
    However, baseline vertical alignment is only applicable for horizontal rows.
    Thus, 1×7×2 combinations less, only 112 variants are left. Then, _a|_b|_e
    alignment makes sense only on the main axis, making it 2×7×3 = 42 less, down
    to 70.`,
  c.H2`Coding`,
  c.P`\
    It is simple to generate all these combinations by running three nested 
    ${KEY`for`} loops, and filtering only for those combinations that it makes
    sense to define (see below):`,
  listing(gen, 16),
  (() => {
    let keys = Object.keys(gen());
    return `classes[${keys.length}] = ${keys.map(k => '.'+k).join(', ')}`;
  })(),
  c.P`\
    The information about alignment and justifying is taken from two-level
    dictionaries, which I have defined as follows:`,
  listing(gen, 1, 16),
  c.P`
    However, it can do better than emitting a large CSS file made of full class
    definitions. Let's make groups of classes that have similar properties.
  `,
  listing(group),
  c.Details(
    c.Summary`This way the listing becomes compact. (Click to expand)`,
    Object.entries(group(gen())).map(([k, v]) =>
      c.P(
        cls.strike(omit.has(k)),
        v.map(k => '.'+k).join(', '), ' { ', c.B(k), '; }'))
  ),
  c.P`\
    Since some properties have default values, they can be omitted and the
    resulting CSS will get more compact. In the above listing such styles
    were struck off.
  `,
  c.P`
    Care must also be taken about the special case of stretching by the
    cross-axis. By default, ${KEY`justify-content: stretch`}
    will apply only to auto-sized elements. I find it more reliable when the
    software does what I tell it to do. Therefore, instead of relying on
    whatever CSS spec authors thought in this case, I will redefine the
    behaviour of that style to stretch the elements as intended.
  `,
  c.P`
    To fix that, I have replaced ${KEY`.class { justify-content: stretch; }`} 
    rules with ${KEY`.class > * { flex: auto; }`}.

  c.H2`Additions`,
  c.P`\
    Some useful additions come to mind. For example, a class that makes the
    children of the container wrap into the next line or column, if all the 
    along the main axis has been taken: ${CODE(CSS_FWR)}
    Another case is the classes that define the proportion in which an
    individual element can grow or shrink: ${CODE(CSS_FL)}
  `,
  c.H2`Conclusion`,
  c.P`\
    Just as we, developers, developers, developers, developers, after a long
    wait, were gracefully endowed with bliss of using flex CSS rules, and not
    coding anymore user interfaces in ways similar to digging trenches with
    toothpicks, by our merciful standards bodies and browser vendors, it took me
    about 40 minutes to implement this system, which then has been serving me
    well for many years. To present this idea to the general public and write
    this article, it took me over two days, after I finally made up my mind to
    do that.
